# AI-Shopping-Cart
Heading to the checkout with a shopping cart full of items, wondering how much you would pay for it only to reach there and find yourself at the end of a long bothersome line is a problem shoppers face in groceries and hypermarkets. The goal of this project is to allow users to see the number of items inside their cart along with the total price as they go about crossing off items from their shopping list. Users only need to drop the item into the cart and they would immediately see the name of the item and its price on a display mounted on the cart. When shopping, if a user changes his mind on a certain item and decides to remove it from the cart the total price would automatically be updated. This creates a seamless experience of adding and removing items from the cart while staying aware of the total cost of your items. Furthermore, at the checkout, the cashier would only need to scan the cart in order to get the total price and charge the customer.
